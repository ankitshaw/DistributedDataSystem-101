## Fundamental Principles of Data Systems

Three fundamental principles of a robust data system are **Reliability**, **Scalability**, **Maintainability**. 

### Reliability

Reliability of a system is of utmost import. The system should be able to tolerate errors and faults; and continue to perform optimally.

### Scalability

A system should be able to scale in case of increase in traffic to the system or data volume. The system should be able to handle load.

### Maintainability

System should be easy to maintain. It should be designed keeping in mind maintainence work like fixing bugs, investigating failures, enhancements in code, adding new features in future.
